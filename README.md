# XNPS

xnps is a reconstructed version of the open-source intranet penetration software nps. It retains the core
functionalities of nps while introducing several key improvements and enhancements. xnps now boasts TCP, UDP, and HTTP
intranet penetration capabilities, making it a versatile and powerful tool for network administrators and developers.

### Key Features

**Enhanced Network Connectivity**: xnps has undergone a complete reconstruction of its network connection component,
ensuring more robust and efficient intranet penetration capabilities.

**SQLite-based Data Management**: To streamline data handling and improve performance, xnps now utilizes SQLite for data
management. This allows for seamless storage and retrieval of configuration, user, and session information.

**Gin Framework for Web Reconstruction**: The web component of xnps has been rebuilt using the Gin framework, a popular
and powerful web framework in Go. This ensures a more responsive and user-friendly web interface for managing and
configuring xnps.

**React-based Frontend Reconstruction**: The frontend of xnps has been reconstructed using React, a leading JavaScript
library for building user interfaces. This allows for a more modern, interactive, and responsive user experience.

**Frontend-Backend Separation**: xnps adopts a frontend-backend separation architecture, enabling greater scalability,
maintainability, and flexibility. This approach allows for independent development and deployment of the frontend and
backend components, improving overall development efficiency.
